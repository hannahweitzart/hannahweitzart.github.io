  In my working process, I chase impressions, feelings and thoughts in a person's eye. My incisive watercolor-portraits aim to provoke a deep sense of fascination and reflection in the viewer. The colourful display contrasts the quiet presentation of feelings and thoughts. Different expressions and cultural backgrounds featured in my work highlight the beauty of variety and peaceful coexistence as well as the unique nature of growing old. Regardless of origin, age or gender, there is and always will be a fascinating beauty in every person. I hunt this down, capturing small but beautiful details in the translucent mode of watercolor.
  <br> <br> Self-taught, I am proud to base my whole artistic progress on talent and discipline as well as the willingness to accept errors in my learning process. I started with pencil drawings in my childhood, later worked with carcoal and focussed on watercolors for several years. As I am open to new, sophisticated drawing and painting styles, I recently started working on a series of oil paintings focussing on the naked female body, movements and self-conscience.
  <br> Still highlighting the beauty of women in my most recent oil paintings, I invite to rethink the image of women in the society, which I perceive in seeing solely the female body as a subject of importance. Incentivising the viewer to reflect on this apparent perspective is the main goal of my upcoming work, which will be released in the upcoming month.
